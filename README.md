My Python Codes to Prepare OSWE exam

Firstly, I examined DVWA [Damn Vulnerable Web App](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/) project by using automated python scripts for everything that includes Main Login Page.
Before try our python scripts, you should install DVWA to your own environment. And then follow your instructions that defined each script.

This is template repository to help OSWE students.
